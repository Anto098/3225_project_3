# 3225_projet3
Gist of the project: 
1) Make a database from [this data](http://w3.usf.edu/FreeAssociation/AppendixA/index.html).
2) Each `(CUE,TARGET)` has an associated `MSG` (Mediated Strength). Implement a website in which users can login, view a `CUE` word, their associated `TARGET` word and `MSG` in the form of a table and histogram.
3) Implement a game in which users can select a `CUE` and gain a number of points determined by the `MSG` relative to the `CUE` for each `TARGET` that they correctly name. 
4) Implement a leaderboards in which you show the top 10 players and their score.
